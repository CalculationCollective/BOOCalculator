# Boo calculator
## Compiling
Step 1: Download [boo](https://github.com/boo-lang/boo/releases)
Step 2: Either run the code using booc or booi
### The difference between booc and booi
booc compiles the code into a .exe file, which you can then execute

booi runs the boo code without compiling it first
